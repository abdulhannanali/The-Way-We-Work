# Time Off and Working Remotely

At Next Big Sound, we believe that you know best when you need to take time off or work outside your normal office hours. That is why we have no formal time off or remote work policy other than "do what's right for you, your team, and NBS". That is also why you do not need to ask your manager for approval for time off or to work remotely.

With that in mind, it's important to communicate any time off clearly and in a timely manner so others can plan accordingly. A good practice for effective communication is:

- Always update the travel calendar with any times that you'll be out or working remotely. It's helpful to include contact & availability information too.

- If you'll be out for a few hours or will be working remotely, post a message in the *nbs-ooo* Slack channel. Use **@here** to ensure that others see your message.

- If you're going to be out for a whole day or more, email everyone an appropriate amount of time in advance.

Use your best judgement and remember that **over-communication is better than under-communication**.
