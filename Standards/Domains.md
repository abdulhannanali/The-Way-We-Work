Domains
=======

What they are
-------------
A domain is a discrete, long-lasting area of skill and activity owned by an established group.

Our domains are:
- **Client:** Communication with our consumers
- **Design:** How it should work
- **Science:** Research & data science
- **Data:** Data ingestion, storage, and processing
- **Systems:** Infrastructure and DevOps
- **Web:** The web-facing product


Why they exist
--------------
As our organization has grown, our work has implicitly clustered around distinct disciplines. This clustering is both natural and necessary, since is no longer possible for any one person to have both a comprehensive _and_ a thorough understanding of all our organization's processes and systems. Explicit domains promote a more scalable sense of ownership.


Responsibilities
----------------
Domains' responsibilities include:
- Ownership of the processes, conventions, and technologies within the domain
- Monitoring, communicating, and caring for the health of the domain
- Organizing and executing work to support cross-domain projects and goals
