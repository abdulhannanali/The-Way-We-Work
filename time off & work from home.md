#Time Off and Working from Home

At Next Big Sound, we believe that you know best when you need to take time off or work outside your normal office hours. That is why we have no formal time off or work-from-home policy other than "do what's right for you, your team, and NBS". That is also why you do not need to ask your manager for approval for time off or to work remotely.

With that in mind, one of the "right" things to do is to communicate clearly and in a timely manner whenever you'll be out of the office. Sending an e-mail as far in advance as possible to everyone who might need to know, and updating the "NBS: Travel" calendar is usually sufficient. You should also include your contact information in both the e-mail and calendar entry, as well as an indication of whether you'll be reachable. 

For example:

* Samir in FL - find me on HipChat or call 954-614-XXXX
* DZ WFH - 347-554-XXXX
* David - vacation - unreachable
