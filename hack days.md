# Hack Days

At Next Big Sound, hacking and inventing has been a tradition of ours since the very beginning. In fact, our first “hack” was the original MySpace parser. A simple web page that made an XHR request to a web-server. That web-server fetched the contents from an XML endpoint, parsed the contents, and returned the value back to the web-client. The web-client made requests every 10 seconds; we left it running overnight and in the morning Akon had generated > 500,000 plays! 

We're focused every day on building the best damn product and making data useful for our customers. More often than not, the most disruptive ideas are what drives this forward. To this end, Next Big Sound has internal hack days to explore and experiment, to disrupt and provide healthy chaos, and to bring to life ideas that once only lived on paper or in your head. 

We’ve scheduled Hack Days every 2 months until the end of 2014. For those new to the process, here’s how they run: 

- During the weeks leading up to a Hack Day, folks are encouraged to add ideas and projects to the Hack Day Ideas Trello board (https://trello.com/b/6Wu6JciJ/hack-day-ideas)
- On Hack Day, people will discuss ideas and select the ones they want to work on
- Hacking happens for the next 48 hours (and, if desired, can continue over the weekend)
- On the following Monday, folks present their hacks during a Demo Day
