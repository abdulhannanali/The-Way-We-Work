Processes
=========

We only have processes that help us do our best work. These are our minimum standards of communication and organization.


Standards
---------

- **Self-selection**<br>
	Each individual chooses what to work on based on what engages them, what will have the biggest impact for others, and their long-term goals.

- **Ownership**<br>
	Each piece of work has a single owner responsible for making sure the work gets done and for communicating about it.

- **Peer-reviewed planning**<br>
	We document peer-reviewed plans before working on non-trivial things.

- **Two-week work cycle**<br>
	We commit to 2 weeks' worth of work at a time.


Organization
------------

We use [Trello](https://trello.com/nextbigsound) to organize, plan, and track our work:

- **Domain boards**<br>
	Each domain has a dedicated board for organizing ideas and a prioritized backlog:
	- [Client Services](https://trello.com/b/okr9dva4/client-requests-feedback)
	- [Product](https://trello.com/b/q3230tSO/product)
	- [Design](https://trello.com/b/lr2yN5wr/design)
	- [Web & API](https://trello.com/b/dG9DBzPy/web-api)
	- [Data Engineering](https://trello.com/b/BgbZtB71/data-engineering)
	- [Research](https://trello.com/b/XcC4d5jA/research)
	- [Systems](https://trello.com/b/auDMPJLS/systems)

- **Project boards**<br>
	Each project has a dedicated board for organizing ideas and a roadmap.

- **Epic board collections**<br>
	Each epic has a dedicated board *collection* for organizing its project's boards and overall roadmap.

- **[_Cycle Planning_ board](https://trello.com/b/7oE9eWyQ/cycle-planning)**<br>
	Contains all work planned for an upcoming cycle in the near future. Work planned for later should be on a domain or project board instead.

- **[_Current Cycle_ board](https://trello.com/b/5l6rv47n/current-cycle)**<br>
	Contains all work committed to the current cycle. Commitments should not change except due to urgent new information.

- **[_Previous Cycles_ board](https://trello.com/b/UYuZcVzq/previous-cycles)**<br>
	Contains all work completed in past cycles.


Schedule
--------

Next Big Sound beats to a 2-week rhythm with occasional planning, status, and retrospective processes along the way.

![Cycle process](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1235062/13420246/bf252640-df52-11e5-9c81-96ca670d7d5e.png)

#### Every quarter:

- **Quarterly prioritization**<br>
	At the start of each quarter, the whole team meets to discuss and prioritize projects for the quarter.

- **[Dogfooding](Dogfooding.md)**<br>
	Once per quarter, the whole team uses the Next Big Sound platform to perform a set of tasks as a user. The resulting feedback is used to identify any bugs and opportunities for improvement.


#### Every cycle:

- **Scoping**<br>
	Prior to the start of each cycle, individuals define and peer-review the scope of work planned for the cycle.

- **Cycle kick-off**<br>
	At the start of each cycle, the whole team meets to discuss, prioritize, and commit to work for the cycle.

- **Cycle retrospective**<br>
	After every cycle, everyone receives an anonymous survey to identify what went well and what didn't.


#### Every week:

- **Friday bagels**<br>
	Every Friday, the whole team meets to share new company-wide and external information and to briefly demo any completed work.

- **Domain on-call**<br>
	Each domain has a weekly on-call rotation where the on-call individual is responsible for communicating issues and scoping bugs in their domain.


#### Ad hoc:

- **Critiques** (aka Crits)<br>
	Individuals host an open feedback meeting in which participants critique some planned work. (e.g. design mockups, architecture plans, data science methodology)

- **Project retrospectives**<br>
	After a project, participating members review what went well, what didn't, and what should be changed.

- **Project demos**<br>
	After a project, interested individuals attend an in-depth demo of a completed project.

- **Post mortems**<br>
	After every outage, everyone involved meets to provide an account of what happened, identify any learnings, and plan next steps.

- **[Ace series](https://trello.com/b/Mzusq8U8/ace-series)**<br>
	Individuals within or outside of Next Big Sound present topics of interest in an occasional lunchtime meeting.
